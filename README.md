# Onset-ObjectInteraction

Hello everyone, this is the first Onset package that I made. Object Interaction is a package that lets you pick objects in order to move them around. You can also store them into your vehicle. Here are some of the functionalities:

* Fully customizable library *
The Object Interaction package was coded in a way that let you use some of its functions for your own package. You will be able to create new ways to play the game. It is also simple to configure and easy to add numerous new element, such as new object, new vehicle, new animation and more.

* Permission system *
The package has a built in way to deal with permission in a way that you can choose who has the right to interact with an object or a vehicle.

* Despawn system *
A despawn system has also been created to deal with the multiple object that might be abandoned on the ground. You will be able to configure the time that an object takes to despawn.

* Advanced interaction *
The "Advanced interaction system" is a system that only lets you do the action that are possible. Instead of having a menu with the all the possible action, it will automatically do the best action based around your surrounding. This can also be disabled or integrated into your own menu system.

* And more *
This is only the beginning of this package. I think there is a lot of possibilities for the future, as well as optimisation.
